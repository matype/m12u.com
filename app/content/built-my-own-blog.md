## Building my blog with React Router

I finally set up my own blog site.

It's built with TypeScript and React Router v7 (framework mode), statically pre-rendered, styled with Tailwind, and deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

To be honest, since it’s basically just loading Markdown files, I probably didn’t need React Router at all—something like Astro would’ve been more than enough. But I wanted an excuse to play around with React Router, so here we are.

Compared to Next.js, I actually prefer this approach because it feels more transparent—I can clearly see what’s going on under the hood. I also like that it leans a little more toward configuration rather than just relying on convention. In reality, it’s not a strict either-or, but more of a spectrum, and for a full-stack framework, I think this balance tilting slightly toward configuration works really well.

I also thought about just writing on Medium or other platforms, but I figured it would be better to have a space where I can freely experiment with tech. This way, I can test things out whenever I want, without restrictions.

With this setup in place, I’m planning to keep writing and documenting my thoughts more regularly from now on.
